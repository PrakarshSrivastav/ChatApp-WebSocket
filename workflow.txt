@Configuration-annotation needed for spring to find and register beans

Workflow of my thinking process to making this app:

1)We are building around the HOT topic of websockets, so firstly we have to set  up the configuration file
for websocket by registering the endpoints and adding a broker.

            a)Endpoints->user connect to this endpoint using SockJS and acts as the backup option if not
                         supported by browser
            b)Broker->In-memory message broker for topics. Any message sent to this will be forwarded to
                      users.

2)Using Redis to configure with DragonDB(supports Redis):

            a)Template->This template is format containing the following data:
                        i)Serilizer for Keys->Readable Strings
                        ii)Jackson2Json for values->Stores in JSON format
            b)Message Listener container-> Listens to the messges published on Redis channels
                        i)Factory->Connects to redis server
                        ii)Handles incoming Messages
